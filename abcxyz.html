              In the next world war
    In a jackknifed juggernaut
    I am born again
    In the neon sign scrolling up and down
    I am born again
    In an interstellar burst
    I am back to save the universe
    In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent
    I am born again
    In a fast German car
    I'm amazed that I survived
    An airbag saved my life
    In an interstellar burst
    I am back to save the universe
    In an interstellar burst
    I am back to save the universe
    In an interstellar burst
    I am back to save the universe
    
    Please could you stop the noise?
    I'm tryna get some rest
    From all the unborn chicken
    Voices in my head
    What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
    What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
    When I am king
    You will be first against the wall
    With your opinion
    Which is of no consequence at all
    What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
    What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La, la
    Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
    Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la-la-la-la
    La-la-la
    You don't remember, you don't remember
    Why don't you remember my name?
    Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
    Why don't you remember my name?
    I guess he does
    Ah, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh, oh, oh
    Oh, oh
    Oh, oh
    Rain down, rain down
    Come on, rain down on me
    From a great height
    From a great height, height
    Rain down, rain down
    Come on, rain down on me
    From a great height
    From a great height, height
    that's it, sir, you're leaving
    The crackle of pigskin (rain down)
    (Come on rain down) the dust and the screaming
    The yuppies networking
    The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
    The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
    God loves his children
    God loves his children, yeah
    
    The breath of the morning
    I keep forgetting
    The smell of the warm summer air
    I live in a town
    Where you can't smell a thing
    You watch your feet
    For cracks in the pavement
    Up above
    Aliens hover
    Making home movies
    For the folks back home
    Of all these weird creatures
    Who lock up their spirits
    Drill holes in themselves
    And live for their secrets
    They're all uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    I wish they'd swoop down in a country lane
    Late at night while I'm driving
    Take me on board of their beautiful ship
    Show me the world as I'd love to see it
    I'd tell all my friends
    But they'd never believe me
    They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
    I'd show them the stars
    And the meaning of life
    They'd shut me away
    But I'd be all right
    All right
    I'm just uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    Uptight
    
    Wake from your sleep
    The drying of your tears
    Today we escape, we escape
    
    Pack and get dressed
    Before your father hears us
    Before all hell breaks loose
    
    Breathe, keep breathing
    Don't lose your nerve
    Breathe, keep breathing
    I can't do this alone
    
    Sing us a song
    A song to keep us warm
    There's such a chill
    Such a chill
    
    And you can laugh a spineless laugh
    We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
    Now we are one in everlasting peace
    We hope that you choke, that you choke
    
    We hope that you choke
    That you choke
    We hope that you choke
    That you choke
    
    Transport
    Motorways and tramlines
    Starting and then stopping
    Taking off and landing
    The emptiest of feelings
    Disappointed people
    Clinging onto bottles
    And when it comes it's so so disappointing
    Let down and hanging around
    Crushed like a bug in the ground
    Let down and hanging around
    Shell smashed, juices flowing
    Wings twitch legs are going
    Don't get sentimental
    It always ends up drivel
    One day I am gonna grow wings
    A chemical reaction
    Hysterical and useless
    Hysterical and
    Let down and hanging around
    Crushed like a bug in the ground
    Let down and hanging around
    Let down and hanging
    Let down
    Let down
    You know, you know where you are with
    You know where you are with
    Floor collapsing, floating
    Bouncing back and
    One day I am gonna grow wings
    A chemical reaction
    (You know where you are)
    Hysterical and useless
    (You know where you are)
    Hysterical and
    (You know where you are)
    Let down and hanging around
    Crushed like a bug in the ground
    Let down and hanging around
    
    Karma police, arrest this man
    He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
    He's like a detuned radio
    Karma police, arrest this girl
    Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
    And we have crashed her party
    
    This is what you'll get
    This is what you'll get
    This is what you'll get
    When you mess with us
    
    Karma police, I've given all I can
    It's not enough, I've given all I can
    But we're still on the payroll
    
    This is what you'll get
    This is what you'll get
    This is what you'll get
    When you mess with us
    
    For a minute there
    I lost myself, I lost myself
    Phew, for a minute there
    I lost myself, I lost myself
    For a minute there

    In a cage
    On antibiotics
    
    I will stop
    I will stop at nothing
    Say the right things
    When electioneering
    I trust I can rely on your vote
    When I go forwards, you go backwards
    And somewhere we will meet
    When I go forwards, you go backwards
    And somewhere we will meet
    Ha, ha, ha
    Riot shields
    Voodoo economics
    It's life, it's life
    It's just business
    Cattle prods and the I.M.F.
    I trust I can rely on your vote
    When I go forwards, you go backwards
    And somewhere we will meet

    I am the key to the lock in your house
    That keeps your toys in the basement
    And if you get too far inside
    You'll only see my reflection
    It's always best when the covers up
    I am the pick in the ice
    Do not cry out or hit the alarm
    You know we're friends till we die
    And either way you turn
    I'll be there
    Open up your skull
    I'll be there
    Climbing up the walls
    It's always best when the light is off
    It's always better on the outside
    Fifteen blows to the back of your head
    Fifteen blows to your mind
    So lock the kids up safe tonight
    Shut the eyes in the cupboard
    I've got the smell of a local man
    Who's got the loneliest feeling
    That either way he turns
    I'll be there
    Open up your skull
    I'll be there
    Climbing up the walls
    Climbing up the walls
    Climbing up the walls
    
    A heart that's full up like a landfill
    A job that slowly kills you
    Bruises that won't heal
    You look so tired, unhappy
    Bring down the government
    They don't, they don't speak for us
    I'll take a quiet life
    A handshake of carbon monoxide
    And no alarms and no surprises
    No alarms and no surprises
    No alarms and no surprises
    Silent, silent
    This is my final fit
    My final bellyache with
    No alarms and no surprises
    No alarms and no surprises
    No alarms and no surprises, please
    Such a pretty house
    And such a pretty garden
    No alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)
    No alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)
    No alarms and no surprises, please (get me out of here)
    
    I'm on a roll
    I'm on a roll, this time
    I feel my luck could change
    Kill me Sarah
    Kill me again with love
    It's gonna be a glorious day
    Pull me out of the air crash
    Pull me out of the lake
    'Cause I'm your superhero
    We are standing on the edge
    The head of state, has called for me, by name
    But I don't have time for him
    It's gonna be a glorious day!
    I feel my luck could change
    Pull me out of the air crash
    Pull me out of the lake
    'Cause I'm your superhero
    We are standing on the edge
    We are standing on the edge
    
    It barks at no one else
    But me
    Like it's seen
    A ghost
    I guess it's seen the sparks
    A-flowin'
    No one else
    Would know
    Hey man, slow down
    Slow down
    Idiot, slow down
    Slow down
    Sometimes I get overcharged
    That's when you
    See sparks
    They ask me where the hell
    I'm going?
    At a thousand feet per second
    Hey man, slow down
    Slow down
    Idiot, slow down
    Slow down
    Hey man, slow down
    Slow down
    Idiot, slow down
    Slow down
